Welcome! I am Longyu Zhou. I have purchased a Ph.D. degree in <a href="https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/" target="_self"> School of Information and Communication Engineering</a> at the University of Electronic Science and Techonology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, 
  China. During my Ph.D. journey, I worked as a visting student in Embedded Systems Group (Supervised by <a href="https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/qing/" target="_self"> Dr. Qing Wang</a>) at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft), Delft, the Netherlands for almost one year. 
  Currently, I am working as a Reserach Fellow in <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/" target="_self"> Information Systems Technology and Design</a>, collaborating to <a href="https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~tonyquek/" target="_self"> Prof. Tony Quek</a> at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore.
