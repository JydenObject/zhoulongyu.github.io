  I am Longyu Zhou. Currently, I am working as a Reserach Fellow in <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/" target="_self"> Information Systems Technology and Design</a>, 
    collaborating to <a href="https://people.sutd.edu.sg/~tonyquek/" target="_self"> Prof. Tony Quek</a>, at Singapore University of Technology and Design (<a \href="https://sutd.edu.sg/" target="_self">SUTD</a>), Singapore.
  </p><p>
  I have purchased a Ph.D. degree in <a href="https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/" target="_self"> School of Information and Communication Engineering</a> at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (<a \href="https://en.uestc.edu.cn/" target="_self">UESTC</a>), Chengdu, 
  China, (2019-2023). During my Ph.D. journey, I worked as a visiting student in <a \href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/embedded-systems/" target="_self">Embedded Systems Group</a>  (Supervised by <a href="https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/qing/" target="_self"> Dr. Qing Wang</a>) at Delft University of Technology (<a \href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/" target="_self">TU Delft</a>), Delft, the Netherlands for almost one year (2022-2023). 
  Before that, I spent one year on my Master's career at UESTC (2018-2019). My bachelor's degree was obtained at Chongqing University of Post and Telecommunications (2014-2018).

    My research focuses on Digital Twin and 6G applications in UAVs-based mobile scenarios with the optimization of Artificial intelligence algorithms such as deep learning, federated learning, and deep reinforcement learning. I have gotten high-quality journal papers (such as IEEE TMC and IEEE TWC) and conference papers with best paper awards. You can find details at <a href="https://zhoulongyu.github.io/publications" target="_self">research page</a> and my <a href="https://zhoulongyu.github.io/tutorials" target="_self">tutorials</a>!
